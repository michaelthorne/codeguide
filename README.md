# HTML & CSS code guide

The purpose of this guide is to help us write reasonably consistent, maintainable and scalable code. Whilst there are brilliant [guidelines](#inspiration) that already exist, I wanted to create one based on my own experiences. Please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/michaelthorne/codeguide/issues/new) if you’d like to contribute.

## [General](#general)

The style in your codebase should appear as if it was written by a single person, regardless of the number of people who contributed to it.

1. It doesn’t matter which guide or code style you ultimately end up using, but just make sure you stick to one.
2. Keep your code readable and easy to understand at all times – be considerate towards the next person who has to work on it.
3. When in doubt, see if there’s an existing pattern that people are using. Or refer to other [guidelines](#inspiration).
