# HTML & CSS code guide

The purpose of this guide is to help us write reasonably consistent, maintainable and scalable code. Whilst there are brilliant [guidelines](#inspiration) that already exist, I wanted to create one based on my own experiences. Please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/michaelthorne/codeguide/issues/new) if you’d like to contribute.

## 1. General

Your codebase should appear as if it was written by a single person, even if multiple people contributed to it.

- It doesn’t matter which guide or code style you ultimately end up using, but just make sure you stick to one.
- Keep your code readable and easy to understand – be considerate towards the next person who has to work on it.
- When in doubt, see if there’s an existing pattern that people are using. Or refer to other [guidelines](#inspiration).

### 1.1 Overview

If you have a text editor or IDE that supports [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org), I highly recommend using it.

- Use 4 spaces for indenting instead of tabs to ensure consistency (_never_ mix spaces and tabs)
- Make use of whitespace to improve readability of the code
- Consider a sensible maximum for line-length e.g. 80 character wide columns
