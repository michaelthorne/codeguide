# HTML & CSS code guide

The purpose of this guide is to help us write reasonably consistent, maintainable and scalable code. Whilst there are brilliant [guidelines](#inspiration) that already exist, I wanted to create one based on my own experiences. Please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/michaelthorne/codeguide/issues/new) if you’d like to contribute.

## 1. General

The style in your codebase should appear as if it was written by a single person, regardless of the number of people who contributed to it.

- It doesn’t matter which guide or code style you ultimately end up using, but just make sure you stick to one.
- Keep your code readable and easy to understand at all times – be considerate towards the next person who has to work on it.
- When in doubt, see if there’s an existing pattern that people are using. Or refer to other [guidelines](#inspiration).
